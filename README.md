Heart Risk Assessment Tool
The Problem 
Heart disease is a significant problem in the US being the leading cause of death. It prevence causes a high burden of disability, premature death, and reduced quality of life for individuals and their families. While there is no “cure” for heart disease, early detection is important as it allows for timely interventions, improves treatment outcomes, and reduces the risk of complications and mortality.
The Hypothesis 
We propose that with enough samples, we can find patterns within the data that can predict heart disease, ideally with a high accuracy. We also predict factors such as lifestyles have a correlation to disease
