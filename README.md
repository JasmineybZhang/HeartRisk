# The Problem 
Heart disease is a significant problem in the US being the leading cause of death. It prevence causes a high burden of disability, premature death, and reduced quality of life for individuals and their families. While there is no “cure” for heart disease, early detection is important as it allows for timely interventions, improves treatment outcomes, and reduces the risk of complications and mortality.
# The Hypothesis 
We propose that with enough samples, we can find patterns within the data that can predict heart disease, ideally with a high accuracy. We also predict factors such as lifestyles have a correlation to disease

# Outline
## Data
Cleaning and transforming the data
->Checked if there were missing values and filled  or deleted it
  Converted the categorical features into numerical using dummies
  Split data between the independent variable(x) and dependent variable or our “target”
  Used train/test split by allocating 80% of the data for training and 20% for testing

## The Algorithm 
Using a supervised machine learning model to fit the problem and then validating its accuracy
-> Needed a supervised machine learning model
  Support Vector Machines - Support Vector Classification
  Linear Support Vector Classification
  Ensemble method -Random Forest
  Choose Random Forest Classifier for its high accuracy and performance which had a score of 89.87%

## Analysis  
Analysis of the features and their relationship to the target 
## Prediction Tool
Make a prediction tool from the model using GUI
